			<string>Constructional Interactions between Humans and Other Animals
                
Increasingly, humans have become part of the lives of other animals and other animals have become part of our lives. The ways in which people and animals interact have changed over time as our understanding of animals’ physical, emotional, and intellectual needs continues to evolve. Currently, many domestic animals and captive exotic animals are dependent on humans for food, water, shelter, and other necessities. Alt- hough the same laws of nature apply to all living organisms, each animal, like each human, is a unique indi- vidual because the animal’s behavior and personality reflects the environmental conditions in which the ani- mal lives. Thus, it is imperative that we understand each animal’s individual needs so that we can construct environments that produce optimal interactions between people and animals. But how do we do this? This presentation will describe an approach derived from Skinner’s functional analysis of behavior that will help us understand the nature of our current interactions with our animals and that can also help us improve these interactions and the animal’s quality of life. This approach is known as constructional behavior analysis (Goldiamond, 1974).</string>

			<string>Service Dogs, Inc. is a 25 year old non-profit whose mission is to increase the independence of people living with disabilities through partnership with a highly trained assistance dog. SDI is one of the few assistance dog organizations to utilize shelter dogs in their program, taking them from “strays to stars.”
                
Members of ABMA come together from different communities within the animal world to share experiences and learn from one another; there is a spirit of collaboration, open mindedness and willingness to learn. What if that type of collaboration happened on a daily basis? SDI found out when we hired a guy from the marine mammal community and partnered him with a girl from the dog community to lead their training department to the next level. This process has been full of debate, epiphanies, compromise and humor. We&apos;ll share the best of our revelations and highlight the unique challenges of operating an assistance dog training program.</string>

What do negative reinforcement and positive punishment have in common with jumbo shrimp and clean dirt? What’s the difference between a NRM and an S-delta? Is behavioral momentum a procedure or a measure? Why do we need LRS when we already have a time out? If terminology tumult is giving you a headache, get relief fast with this Lunch and Learn!
                
Susan G. Friedman, Ph.D. is a faculty member in the Department of Psychology at Utah State University. She has helped pioneer the cross-species application of behavior analysis to animals, using the same humane philosophy and scientifically sound teaching technology that has been so effective with human learners. She has written chapters in three veterinary texts, and her popular magazine articles have been translated in 11 languages (www.behaviorworks.org). Susan also writes a blog for Psychology Today (www.pyschologytoday.com). She has given seminars on learning and behavior at conferences and zoos in many countries around the world. Teaching her on-line class for professionals, Living and Learning with Ani- mals, has provided even wider dissemination of effective and humane behavior change practices.</string>

			<string>Part 1: 60 Years of Getting Behavior
Dr. Robert (Bob) Bailey
            
I describe myself as a behavioral-systems analyst and engineer, small-businessman, field biologist, animal trainer, and teacher, not necessarily in that order. My early years in the 1940s were spent trekking the desert looking for animals in the San Fernando Valley. I graduated from UCLA (Biology and Chemistry) in the 1950s and was a teaching and research assistant, studying animals in the Southwestern USA and Mexico. My train- ing experience at UCLA includes crows, coyotes, and kangaroo rats in the wild, and captive, cephalopods, amphibians, fishes, and reptiles. I was largely self-taught, and read the works of B. F. Skinner and Keller and Marian Breland, among others. I was awarded the Doctor of Science Degree (Sc.D.) from the University of Central Arkansas in 2013 for the study and international development of biological systems.

After two years as a biochemist at the UCLA School of Medicine, I became the US Navy Marine Mammal Pro- gram’s first Director of Training (1962) at Pt. Mugu, California, and conducted the Navy’s first open-ocean release of a dolphin. From 1962 to 1965 I worked directly with Marian and Keller Breland, Animal Behavior Enterprises (ABE), in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1965 I left the Navy to join ABE and eventually became the Chief Operating Officer. ABE’s business was worldwide in scope and I directed the activities of more than 40 full-time and 50 part-time employees until I closed the operations in 1990. We trained over 140 species and more than 15,000 individual animals.

ABE’s clients included most of the major American theme parks, as well as a number of zoological parks, in- cluding the San Diego Zoo, Forest Park Zoo (TX), and the Swope Park Zoo (MO). ABE also developed biologi- cal systems for the USA and other governments. ABE began teaching science-based animal training proce- dures in the late 1940s, and I continue to develop behavioral systems and teach animal trainers and other behavior technologists around the world, nearly 70 years later.</string>

			<string>Baiting and Luring – Using Them Effectively is as Easy as ABC
                
Baiting or luring an animal to encourage a desired behavior is frequently used, and can be a very effective tool in behavior modification. Too often, however, it becomes a crutch; and the animal learns to rely on the bait to perform the behavior at all. This presentation will demonstrate why this frequently occurs, and will give participants simple and easily used methods to avoid this behavioral pitfall. Using the ABC’s of operant conditioning – antecedent, behavior, consequence – attendees will learn to use baiting and luring effectively, and especially how to fade out the use of the bait in order to get behaviors under stimulus control more ef- fectively.
                
Heidi Hellmuth has 25+ years’ experience in the animal care and behavior field. Her career has included roles such as marine animal trainer, zoo keeper, wildlife educator, supervisor, and curator. She has been fortunate to have worked with many species and diverse taxa over the years. Heidi is currently the zoological curator of Northwest Trek Wildlife Park, a unique 725 acre facility in Eatonville, Washington.</string>

			<string>The Difference a Measure Makes: How Science and Practical Solutions Can Take Your Training to a New Level
                
Studying animal behavior is like solving a mystery. Start with the clues, which generate questions. Then develop a hypothesis as to what’s going on and make predictions based on your hypothesis. Next decide how best to make observations and which measurements are appropriate to test your predictions. Don’t miss Dr. Yin’s primer on conducting behavioral research including the scientific approach, developing a hypothesis, designing a study to test the hypothesis, gathering data and analyzing the results. Extra time is devoted to what makes behavioral research different from research in other fields and sample problems will be presented so attendees get a chance to work through the process of developing a question, mak- ing a hypothesis and then testing the hypothesis. This will help all attendees learn to think analytically.
                
Dr. Sophia Yin is a veterinarian, applied animal behaviorist, and the author of many books, including Perfect Puppy in 7 Days, How to Behavior So Your Dog Behaves, and Low Stress Handling, Restraint and Behavior Modification of Dogs and Cats (book and DVD). She sees behavior house calls and lectures and teaches workshops on animal behavior, training, and low-stress pet handling in the U.S. and internationally. She writes for a number of veterinary and popular magazines, and was for five years the award-winning pet columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. She has consulted for several zoos and served as a behavior expert for TV shows such as Animal Planet’s Dogs 101. Dr. Yin’s mission in life is to improve our understanding of animals and their behavior so that we can care for, appreciate, and enjoy our time with them better.

			<string>The Soul of All Living Creatures
What Animals Can Teach Us about Being Human
                
Based on the author’s twenty-five years of experience as a veterinarian and veterinary behaviorist, The Soul of All Living Creatures delves into the inner lives of animals – from whales, wolves, and leopards to mice, dogs, and cats – and explores the relationships we forge with them.
                
As an emergency room clinician four years out of veterinary school, Dr. Vint Virga had a life-changing experience: he witnessed the power of simple human contact and compassion to affect the recovery of a dog struggling to survive after being hit by a car. Observing firsthand the remarkably strong connection between humans and animals inspired him to explore the world from the viewpoint of animals and taught him to respect the kinship that connects us.
                
With The Soul of All Living Creatures, Virga draws from his decades in veterinary practice to reveal how, by striving to perceive the world as animals do, we can enrich our own appreciation of life, enhance our character, nurture our relationships, improve our communication with others, reorder our values, and deepen our grasp of spirituality. Virga discerningly illuminates basic traits shared by both humans and animals and makes animal behavior meaningful, relevant, and easy to understand. Insightful and eloquent, The Soul of All Living Creatures offers an intimate journey into the lives of our fellow creatures and a thought-provoking promise of what we can learn from spending time with them.
                
For over twenty-five years, Dr. Virga has been a distinguished practitioner and leader in veterinary medicine, recognized for his insights into our relationships with animals. His expertise spans the animal kingdom from dogs and cats to wild species such as leopards, gibbons, wolves, and giraffes. As the founder and CEO of Vet- erinary Healing Arts, he has worked extensively with dogs, cats, and their human families on behavioral issues of concern to them and currently serves as a consultant to zoos and wild animal parks on the behavioral well -being and management of animals in their care.
                
A recognized expert on animal behavior and a prominent advocate for nurturing the human-animal bond, Dr. Virga has appeared as a featured guest on ABC World News, PBS Nature, and National Geographic Explorer. Outside of clinical practice, he has served as an advisor to leading U.S. corporations, professional associations, and animal welfare organizations; a veterinary liaison to the U.S. congress; and an expert on legal and legislative issues concerning animal health and welfare. He is distinguished for his insights into the parallels between human and animal behavior – making animal behavior meaningful, relevant, and easy to understand.
                
In his writing, Dr. Virga portrays a unique sensitivity and compassion toward both humans and animals. His first book, The Soul of All Living Creatures, was published by Random House / Crown in July 2013 and will be released in paperback this coming July. He writes a regular blog for Psychology Today and has contributed to Conjunctions, Biographile, MindBodyGreen, Books for Better Living, and TheDodo.com. In recognition of his writing, Dr. Virga has been awarded two MacDowell Fellowships and a George and Kate Kendall Fellowship.
                
Dr. Virga received his Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine from the University of California, Davis and complet- ed his clinical residency in behavioral medicine at Cornell University. He is board-certified in veterinary be- havior and a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists.
                
Dr. Virga lives in southern New England with his wife, daughter, and two Norwegian forest cats.</string>

Historically, learning and behavior has been described as two distinct learning mechanisms, classical and operant. Although the distinction is fuzzy, given that both processes are ongoing all the time, a solid understanding of the differences can influence how we approach our behavior change interventions.</string>

			<string>The Right Tool for the Job
            
The move toward more positive, less intrusive training methods has significantly improved the welfare of many animals at zoological facilities. However, positive reinforcement training alone doesn’t guarantee wel- fare benefits for animals in human care. It is sometimes the case that animals have experienced better welfare before the implementation of a positive reinforcement training program.

Recognizing that humans and other animals are individually unique, the right tool for the job should be meas- ured on a case-by-case basis, change with current conditions, and be evaluated using an ethical benchmark.

The AZA Animal Welfare Committee defines Animal Welfare as “An animal’s collective physical, mental, and emotional states over a period of time, and is measurable on a continuum from good to poor.” Practitioners trained in applied behavior analysis (ABA) are legally held to the least intrusive procedural guideline when changing children’s behavior problems. With the AZA and ABA statements above as our benchmarks, this pa- per will explore animal training and management practices emphasizing how we choose the right animal, trainer, and technology for a variety of common challenges in zoological facilities.

Steve Martin began his professional animal training career when he set up the first of its kind, free-flight bird show at the San Diego Wild Animal Park in 1976. The show gained world acclaim for its unique ability to com- bine the entertainment of birds performing natural behaviors with inspirational conservation messages.

In 1984 Steve Martin began teaching animal keepers the art and science of behavior change to enhance the husbandry, enrichment, and behavioral management of exhibit animals. He has now served as an animal be- havior and visitor experience consultant for about 100 zoological facilities in over 20 countries. Steve is an in- structor at the AZA Animal Training School, an instructor at the Elephant Management School in Hamburg Germany, a Trustee with the World Parrot Trust, and President of both Natural Encounters, Inc. (NEI) and Nat- ural Encounters Conservation Fund, Inc. (NECF) a company dedicated to raising money for conservation pro- grams. NECF has now raised and donated well over one million dollars to in situ conservation programs around the world.

Steve Martin has a strong commitment to conservation and helping people understand their relationship with the living earth. The Mission Statement of NEI is “Connecting Humans with the Natural World” and Earth Day is an official holiday for all NEI employees.
