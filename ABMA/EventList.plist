			<string>Constructional Interactions between Humans and Other Animals
                
Increasingly, humans have become part of the lives of other animals and other animals have become part of our lives. The ways in which people and animals interact have changed over time as our understanding of animals’ physical, emotional, and intellectual needs continues to evolve. Currently, many domestic animals and captive exotic animals are dependent on humans for food, water, shelter, and other necessities. Alt- hough the same laws of nature apply to all living organisms, each animal, like each human, is a unique indi- vidual because the animal’s behavior and personality reflects the environmental conditions in which the ani- mal lives. Thus, it is imperative that we understand each animal’s individual needs so that we can construct environments that produce optimal interactions between people and animals. But how do we do this? This presentation will describe an approach derived from Skinner’s functional analysis of behavior that will help us understand the nature of our current interactions with our animals and that can also help us improve these interactions and the animal’s quality of life. This approach is known as constructional behavior analysis (Goldiamond, 1974).</string>

			<string>Service Dogs, Inc. is a 25 year old non-profit whose mission is to increase the independence of people living with disabilities through partnership with a highly trained assistance dog. SDI is one of the few assistance dog organizations to utilize shelter dogs in their program, taking them from “strays to stars.”
                
Members of ABMA come together from different communities within the animal world to share experiences and learn from one another; there is a spirit of collaboration, open mindedness and willingness to learn. What if that type of collaboration happened on a daily basis? SDI found out when we hired a guy from the marine mammal community and partnered him with a girl from the dog community to lead their training department to the next level. This process has been full of debate, epiphanies, compromise and humor. We&apos;ll share the best of our revelations and highlight the unique challenges of operating an assistance dog training program.</string>

			<string>Part 1: 60 Years of Getting Behavior
Dr. Robert (Bob) Bailey
            
I describe myself as a behavioral-systems analyst and engineer, small-businessman, field biologist, animal trainer, and teacher, not necessarily in that order. My early years in the 1940s were spent trekking the desert looking for animals in the San Fernando Valley. I graduated from UCLA (Biology and Chemistry) in the 1950s and was a teaching and research assistant, studying animals in the Southwestern USA and Mexico. My train- ing experience at UCLA includes crows, coyotes, and kangaroo rats in the wild, and captive, cephalopods, amphibians, fishes, and reptiles. I was largely self-taught, and read the works of B. F. Skinner and Keller and Marian Breland, among others. I was awarded the Doctor of Science Degree (Sc.D.) from the University of Central Arkansas in 2013 for the study and international development of biological systems.

After two years as a biochemist at the UCLA School of Medicine, I became the US Navy Marine Mammal Pro- gram’s first Director of Training (1962) at Pt. Mugu, California, and conducted the Navy’s first open-ocean release of a dolphin. From 1962 to 1965 I worked directly with Marian and Keller Breland, Animal Behavior Enterprises (ABE), in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1965 I left the Navy to join ABE and eventually became the Chief Operating Officer. ABE’s business was worldwide in scope and I directed the activities of more than 40 full-time and 50 part-time employees until I closed the operations in 1990. We trained over 140 species and more than 15,000 individual animals.

ABE’s clients included most of the major American theme parks, as well as a number of zoological parks, in- cluding the San Diego Zoo, Forest Park Zoo (TX), and the Swope Park Zoo (MO). ABE also developed biologi- cal systems for the USA and other governments. ABE began teaching science-based animal training proce- dures in the late 1940s, and I continue to develop behavioral systems and teach animal trainers and other behavior technologists around the world, nearly 70 years later.</string>

			<string>Baiting and Luring – Using Them Effectively is as Easy as ABC
                
Baiting or luring an animal to encourage a desired behavior is frequently used, and can be a very effective tool in behavior modification. Too often, however, it becomes a crutch; and the animal learns to rely on the bait to perform the behavior at all. This presentation will demonstrate why this frequently occurs, and will give participants simple and easily used methods to avoid this behavioral pitfall. Using the ABC’s of operant conditioning – antecedent, behavior, consequence – attendees will learn to use baiting and luring effectively, and especially how to fade out the use of the bait in order to get behaviors under stimulus control more ef- fectively.

			<string>Dr. Sophia Yin
                
                Studying animal behavior is like solving a mystery. Start with the clues, which generate questions. Then develop a hypothesis as to what’s going on and make predictions based on your hypothesis. Next decide how best to make observations and which measurements are appropriate to test your predictions. Don’t miss Dr. Yin’s primer on conducting behavioral research including the scientific approach, developing a hypothesis, designing a study to test the hypothesis, gathering data and analyzing the results. Extra time is devoted to what makes behavioral research different from research in other fields and sample problems will be presented so attendees get a chance to work through the process of developing a question, mak- ing a hypothesis and then testing the hypothesis. This will help all attendees learn to think analytically.
                
                Dr. Sophia Yin is a veterinarian, applied animal behaviorist, and the author of many books, including Per- fect Puppy in 7 Days, How to Behavior So Your Dog Behaves, and Low Stress Handling, Restraint and Behavior Modification of Dogs and Cats (book and DVD). She sees behavior house calls and lectures and teaches workshops on animal behavior, training, and low-stress pet handling in the U.S. and internationally. She writes for a number of veterinary and popular magazines, and was for five years the award-winning pet columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. She has consulted for several zoos and served as a behavior expert for TV shows such as Animal Planet’s Dogs 101. Dr. Yin’s mission in life is to improve our understanding of animals and their behavior so that we can care for, appreciate, and enjoy our time with them better.

			<string>Camelid Handling Problem Solving with Antecedent Arrangements</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Marty McGee Bennett B.S. Animal Behavior; CAMELIDynamics
                
                Many management and behavior problems encountered with llamas and alpacas (be it in a zoo setting or private farm setting) can be solved with thoughtful antecedent arrangements. This talk will outline and discuss the connection between traditional handling techniques used with llamas and alpacas and com- mon behavioral issues. I will illustrate how these problems can be eliminated or managed successfully with clever changes to the environment and approach to handling. For example:
                * The use of a optimally sized catch pen.
                * The use of smaller pens as well as specially shaped pens for management tasks that require more containment in place of physical restraint
                
                
                I will discuss specialized catching tools and techniques, such as using balance to desensitize the camelid to a human&apos;s approach— thereby making the animals less flighty, more useful in a public setting and easier to manage for herd health tasks.
                
                I will describe techniques such as:
                * The very precise offering of an escape route inside a small area and how this technique can be used in place of food reinforcers to avoid fearful reactions.
                * Selective use of crowding with multiple animals can be used to accomplish medical tasks such as giving injections or management tasks such as trimming toenails.
                
                The talk will also include specific useful information about the critical importance of halter fit for camelids. As semi-obligate nasal breathers with an upright posture and small heads and long necks, improper halter fit is a huge problem whose ramifications are often misunderstood.</string>

			<string>Training Emergency Recall in Multiple Species</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Tara Gifford; Ohio Animal Training LLC
                
                Being prepared for emergencies is a part of any zoo&apos;s protocols. There are many types of emergencies that can occur at a zoo involving people and/or animals. Having a plan to get dangerous animals off exhibit in the event of bad weather, animal escapes or an unwanted addition to an exhibit is a part of good management. Training animals to carry out an emergency recall can save precious time and potentially save lives. This paper will discuss the training process of big cats, bears, apes, large hoof stock and reptiles for a behavior to bring them off exhibit and secure them in a holding area. Training for a quick response at any time of day in the presence of distractions has proven to be a valuable tool.</string>

			<string>Thinking Outside the Box and Breaking the Enrichment Ceiling across Species</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Pat Bennett; Strikeflight, A Division Of Wicked International LLC
                
                Q. Is there a single type of enrichment protocol that can be adapted to high-level, pan-species enrichment activities in multiple environments that stimulates and enhances species-specific, species-appropriate behavior?
                
                A. The ability to function in the manner of the species is the single most compelling issue when developing enrichment tools for multiple species of captive predators.
                Canine lure coursing equipment has only been used for running cheetahs and limited types of other large predators since approximately 2000 – very new to the enrichment arena.
                We have designed highly adaptable, state-of-the-art portable coursing equipment that has worked with a wide variety of enclosures in any environment imaginable, from the sides of trees for use with leaping cara- cals, to upside-down placement in the ceilings and/or on multi-level tiers of tiger enclosures, to aquatic envi- ronments with fishing cats or otters, to aerial displays for raptors – all to the enormous benefit of the animals, both physically and mentally. One adaptable machine can fill many roles at the same zoo or other facility and can be shared by a variety of departments, creating a cost-efficient yet cutting-edge solution to multiple- species’ enrichment programs. There is no other enrichment tool that is so extremely adaptable to such wide- spread uses in animal behavior management and enrichment.
                
                Conclusion: Well-designed coursing equipment is highly adaptable to any type of enclosure or exhibit. Its use can prevent physical and mental deterioration and vastly improves the lives and welfare of all animals.</string>

			<string>Creating a Heart Healthy Mate</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Christina Eastwood; Dallas Zoo
                
                The Dallas Zoo obtained 1.1 Red River Hogs which were recommended for breeding by the SSP. The pair, 1.0 “Hank” and 0.1 “Riley”, have bred on multiple occasions since December 2011, but have not produced offspring. Hank gradually became overweight when he moved to his current habitat in May 2010. There is a hypothesis among Suidae managers that successful copulation is linked to a healthy weight. In an attempt to stimulate a more successful breeding program with our Red River Hogs, a goal was set in June 2012 to transform our male Red River Hog into a heart healthy mate. To achieve this goal, the trainers decided the best method would be to train a behavior that would not only assist with weight loss, but would also be educational for the visitors. We chose to train a running behavior that would be shown on exhibit during visitor hours, along with other natural behaviors. A shaping plan was written and executed until the final behavior was completed in May 2013. The combination of his training and a new diet allowed him to lose 17.8 kilograms (39.2 pounds) over a six month period. Hank reached his ideal weight at approximately 87 kilograms (191.8 pounds). The Dallas Zoo is anxious to see if Hank’s new exercise program will have a positive impact on the pair’s breeding success.</string>

			<string>Training Voluntary Reproductive Assessments and Artificial Insemination with African Elephants (Loxodonta Africana) In a Protected Contact Environment</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Maura Middleton and Michael Burns; Tampa&apos;s Lowry Park Zoo
                
                While making great strides with the new elephant program at Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo, we have had to face numerous challenges that accompany the management and training styles we utilize. The most recent chal- lenge we faced is the need to perform full reproductive assessments and the artificial insemination of our 32 year old cow. This feat seemed difficult as our training philosophy does not include the use of tethers or re- straints. With safety of staff being our main priority, along with our determination to ensure voluntary partici- pation from all animals, we designed and utilized an Elephant Reproductive Assessment Device (ERAD) that is installed directly into our medical chute. This device allows for the veterinary staff to work under an elephant in a protected area while managing the elephant in a stress free manner during an invasive and sensitive pro- cedure. Since development, we have utilized the ERAD for an artificial insemination of an adult who was raised in human care as well as an exploratory scoping procedure on a full term pregnant female who was im- ported in 2003 as a young adult. Though the backgrounds of the individuals varied greatly, the combination of training and innovation resulted in the ability to perform the behaviors completely, with no restraints, while maintaining the safety of all staff members.</string>

			<string>Utilizing Operant Conditioning and Passive Restraint to Identify and Treat a Fungal Infection in an At- lantic Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops Truncatus)</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Lisa Mignogna*, Michael Hunt, Billy Hurley, Tonya Clauss DVM, &amp; Gregory D. Bossart VMD; Georgia State Aquarium
                
                Voluntary diagnostic samples are collected quarterly on the population of dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at Georgia Aquarium. In October 2011, results from a routine blowhole sample revealed fungal hyphae and a positive fungal culture with the identification of Cunninghamella bertholletiae on “Makana”, a male Tursiops truncatus. Through the application of systematic desensitization, the animal training and veterinary teams worked together to implement a rigorous diagnostic and treatment plan for this fungus.
                
                This presentation will highlight how operant conditioning and positive reinforcement has led to the success of a voluntary treatment plan for Makana. Throughout this process, Makana was conditioned to receive a nasal sinus cavity flush, passive restraint for radiographs, the administration of nebulized medication via a ‘steering wheel’ chamber, and a full, computed tomography (CT) scan of his melon, thorax, and partial abdomen to determine the extent of the infection.</string>

			<string>A Tall List in Short Order: Developing a Positive Reinforcement Based Cheetah Training Program to Meet Programming and Collection Management Goals</string>

			<string>BMF Travel Scholarship Winner
                Justin Garner and Antonio Ramirez; Sea World Parks &amp; Entertainment - Busch Gardens Tampa
                
                In 2011, Busch Gardens Tampa opened a new dynamic cheetah exhibit and presentation area, “Cheetah Run”. The mission was to set a new benchmark in animal training, management, and conservation, as well as to connect guests to wildlife in exciting new ways. A team of trainers were tasked with developing a training program that would consistently satisfy seven main objectives: conditioned husbandry behaviors, daily lure runs, free contact cheetah/trainer presentations, sustainable breeding, maintaining long term compatibility within social groups, and exhibit cheetahs. These goals were set for the entire collection. Most of the animals needed to be proficient in leash walking, lure running, and conditioned husbandry. The animals’ experiences range from young naïve animals to older animals with aversive histories both hand and parent-reared. These goals require free and protected contact interactions. All of the animals needed to be traditional cheetah ambassadors and most importantly have a behavioral repertoire that was conditioned through operant conditioning utilizing solely positive reinforcement. The theme park environment comes with its own unique set of challenges. To begin, the entire collection had to be desensitized to all environmental stimuli including the coaster that passes overhead of the area, music, large crowds, and even fireworks.
                
                This paper will demonstrate how the fundamental and exclusive use of positive reinforcement was paramount in achieving our goals with the collection in a short amount of time. Additionally, it will discuss the unique challenges that were presented, processes that were applied, knowledge gained, and plans for the continual growth.</string>

			<string>Manding, a Case Study of Giraffe Exhibiting Novel Learned Behavior</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Extended Presentation
                Lisa Clifton-Bumpass; A Step Beyond
                
                Giraffe living in captivity are undergoing extensive training to better their lives, reduce the stress and the intrusion of daily husbandry care, and increase their long-term welfare through mental stimulation and enrichment. As giraffe live longer, caring for the normal age-related health issues, chronic health problems, and specific geriatric needs require husbandry staff to develop strategies creating responsive cooperative care protocols.
                
                Exotic and domestic animals are being taught many new kinds of behaviors via Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), the arm of psychology focused on the observable relationship between behavior and the environment. In 1957, B.F. Skinner classified a group of behavioral signals from non-verbal individuals who used signals to communicate a specific need for remedy of an internal aversive state that they could not change without the help of another. This is referred to as a mand. The mand is the result of operant conditioning whereby the learner uses what it has learned to signal the need for relief.
                
                We will examine the training of two giraffes living in different holding facilities that independently developed a signal expressing a need for specific husbandry protocols to alleviate their physical discomfort. Both individuals learned to use an aspect of their training as a signal for specific treatments that are designed to bring relief. “Tiki”, a 25 year old female giraffe at the Oakland Zoo, and “Rosie”, a 4 year old female giraffe at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, developed these operant class signal behaviors which are directly related to their training history.</string>

			<string>Ante Up! The Influence of Antecedents in Training</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Andy Hall; AvianWise
                
                The specific environmental situation in which a behavior occurs is often overlooked as an integral part of training and behavior modification. These antecedents are often given a back seat to the influence of the consequences following the behavior, but they are advised as the first place to begin in effective and ethically grounded training strategies. Often antecedent arrangement can lead to a less coercive training strategy and allow positive reinforcement to replace punishment. This paper will explore the influence antecedents have on desirable and undesirable behaviors, their impact on the value and success of the resulting consequences, and how identification, description, and rearrangement of antecedents can be used to successfully change behavior.</string>

			<string>Exploring Reptile Training at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Genevieve Warner and Lauren Augustine; Department of Herpetology, Center for Animal Care Sciences, Smithsonian’s National Zoological Park
                
                The animal keepers at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s Reptile Discovery Center (RDC) employ all types of training techniques with every order of reptile. In the past decade, veteran keepers have been slowly conditioning animals to perform specific behaviors to facilitate captive husbandry. Although these keepers are inadvertently or unintentionally training their animals, typically they are not employing by-the-book techniques. Standardized training protocols often discourage cognitive training efforts by keepers who feel that these protocols are too focused on procedure rather than an animal’s natural history and behavioral response. Although these training techniques differ from the methods of operant conditioning typically taught to animal care professionals, the results are just as amazing and beneficial. Recently, RDC staff have been utilizing all types of training to further explore reptile cognition. For example, the social hierarchy of three false water cobras (Hydrodynastes gigas) and reverse learning in green tree monitors (Varanus prasinus). Additionally, a recent publication on skilled forelimb movements in black tree monitors, Varanus beccarii (Mendyk and Horn, 2011) led RDC keepers to exploring this type of cognitive behavior in green tree monitors (Varanus prasinus), Merten’s water monitors (Varanus mertensi) and Komodo Dragons (Varanus komodoensis). Furthermore, amazing behaviors such as Merten’s water monitors (Varanus. mertensi) corralling fish with their bodies have been observed just by experimenting with water levels and live prey. Presenting our experiences with reptile training and cognition will hopefully inspire others to train their reptiles, as reptiles have the capacity to be trained for routine husbandry and veterinary care.</string>

			<string>Julie Grove; The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore
                
                I would like the opportunity to share with other zoo professionals the many benefits to both animal training and enrichment programs since the creation of my position at The Maryland Zoo. My position is part time and encompasses the management of all training and enrichment programs throughout the zoo. During my zoo career I have worked as a keeper and a manager in multiple animal areas. This experience has helped substantially in my current role. Communication, planning and organization are keys to successfully managing training and enrichment programs. My role involves mentoring keepers while assisting them with training zoo wide. I am also responsible for working to maintain and improve enrichment programs. I am the liaison between keepers, area managers, collection managers and veterinary staff concerning animal training and enrichment. During my tenure, many training goals have been met including voluntary injections, blood collection, and ultrasound procedures to name a few. Communication, planning and organization have played a critical role in shaping and maintaining these complex behaviors. I would also like the opportunity to discuss the benefits of working with volunteers and interns to further enhance these programs. With the help of many contributors I created an enrichment committee and an enrichment documenting and cataloging system. My long term goal is to ensure that we continue to make progress in both programs while bridging gaps along the way that help all individuals involved become a part of future successes.</string>

			<string>The Soul of All Living Creatures
                What Animals Can Teach Us about Being Human
                
                Based on the author’s twenty-five years of experience as a veterinarian and veterinary behaviorist, The Soul of All Living Creatures delves into the inner lives of animals – from whales, wolves, and leopards to mice, dogs, and cats – and explores the relationships we forge with them.
                
                As an emergency room clinician four years out of veterinary school, Dr. Vint Virga had a life-changing experience: he witnessed the power of simple human contact and compassion to affect the recovery of a dog struggling to survive after being hit by a car. Observing firsthand the remarkably strong connection between humans and animals inspired him to explore the world from the viewpoint of animals and taught him to respect the kinship that connects us.
                
                With The Soul of All Living Creatures, Virga draws from his decades in veterinary practice to reveal how, by striving to perceive the world as animals do, we can enrich our own appreciation of life, enhance our character, nurture our relationships, improve our communication with others, reorder our values, and deepen our grasp of spirituality. Virga discerningly illuminates basic traits shared by both humans and animals and makes animal behavior meaningful, relevant, and easy to understand. Insightful and eloquent, The Soul of All Living Creatures offers an intimate journey into the lives of our fellow creatures and a thought-provoking promise of what we can learn from spending time with them.
                
                For over twenty-five years, Dr. Virga has been a distinguished practitioner and leader in veterinary medicine, recognized for his insights into our relationships with animals. His expertise spans the animal kingdom from dogs and cats to wild species such as leopards, gibbons, wolves, and giraffes. As the founder and CEO of Vet- erinary Healing Arts, he has worked extensively with dogs, cats, and their human families on behavioral issues of concern to them and currently serves as a consultant to zoos and wild animal parks on the behavioral well -being and management of animals in their care.
                
                A recognized expert on animal behavior and a prominent advocate for nurturing the human-animal bond, Dr. Virga has appeared as a featured guest on ABC World News, PBS Nature, and National Geographic Ex- plorer. Outside of clinical practice, he has served as an advisor to leading U.S. corporations, professional as- sociations, and animal welfare organizations; a veterinary liaison to the U.S. congress; and an expert on legal and legislative issues concerning animal health and welfare.
